# Hangman-GUI
> This project was made during practice on [Google Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/resources/hangman-solutions-open-source-answer/#!)  

When the user plays **Hangman**, the computer first selects a secret word at random from a list built into
the program. The program then prints out a row of dashes—one for each letter in the secret word—and
asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is redisplayed
with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed
on previous turns. If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess.
The user keeps guessing letters until one of the following happens:
1. The user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word
2. The user has made eight incorrect guesses.

Upon every incorrect guess, the hangman model is completed step by step.

## Requirements
> Python  
> [Graphics](https://pypi.org/project/graphics.py/) Module  

## Improvements
Can be deployed in Gitpod with some extra features like for hints etc.  


***Happy Pythoning!***
